    st.write("While it wasn't very impressive, it was my first attempt into the world of web development. Even when it was simply a straightforward static website, I can still feel the excitement of watching my code come to life. It gave me a great sense of satisfaction to see what I made online.")

    st.write("Next.js was like a breath of fresh air. The development process was significantly more straightforward because of the full stack capabilities and built-in routing. I was able to focus more on developing and less on configuring, which improved my understanding of modern web development methodologies.")

My journey as a developer is one of continuous growth and change, whether it's learning new frameworks, being up to date with web development trends, or diving further into backend technologies.")
